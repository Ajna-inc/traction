// Global modifications to PrimeVue components here
// Note if general global theming (colors mostly) needs changing, look to the pulled in _theme file 
// Can adjust ALL instances of a PrimeVue component her by just overriding the classes,
// or if you want a component that only sometimes gets modified, can add another .traction class to it
// like if we want a bunch of tables to get overriden style (but still want other customizable or default,
// add .traction-table and nest style from that

// Dialogs
.p-dialog-content {
  input {
    min-width: 400px;
  }
}
