# OpenAPI generated FastAPI server

This Python package is automatically generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project:

- API version: v0.7.2
- Build package: org.openapitools.codegen.languages.PythonFastAPIServerCodegen

## Requirements.

Python >= 3.7

## Traction Overview

This package provides ACA-Py wrapper endpoints for a Traction client, for ACA-Py services that are *not* included in the Traction framework.

These services are *not* intended to be called from within Traction services.

The endpoint implementation basically proxies the request and calls the corresponding ACA-Py endpoint, returning the results to the caller.

## ACA-Py Swagger Modifications Required

The ACA-Py-generated openapi.json document generates code which cannot be compiled or run, the following modifications were necessary:

- Inputs and return values defined as `object` were changed to `dict`
- Added input parameter `request: Request` and removed `token_AuthorizationHeader` from all endpoints
- Added `Config` to model objects whose attribute names conflict with openapi, e.g.:

```
def json_field(string: str) -> str:
    if string == "json":
        return "input_json"
    return string

...
    class Config:
        alias_generator = json_field
```

- Added `Config` with `check_fields=False` to model objects because ...  I can't remember, some compile error in the generated code:

```
    class Config:
        check_fields = False
```
